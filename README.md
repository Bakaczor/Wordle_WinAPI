# Wordle_WinAPI_Project

This Wordle application was created as part of the course 
"Programming in a graphical environment" at the Warsaw University
of Techonology. The project is purely didactic - I do not claim

For the game to work properly, in the folder with the executable file,
there should be a .txt file with the same name, from which the game dictionary will be loaded.
